<plan> Planning: decompose the question into sub-goals and decide what to do next. Use when: the task starts, or the previous step went well and you need to move forward.
<verify> Verification: check whether the latest search results match your expectation, and check your candidate answer against ALL constraints stated in the question one by one. Use when: every time you receive search results; you MUST verify before giving the final answer.
<reflect> Reflection: diagnose what went wrong — the search returned nothing useful, contradicts your expectation, or an error occurred; analyze the cause. Use when: any anomalous signal appears.
<backtrack> Backtracking: conclude that the current line of attack is a dead end, explicitly abandon it, and state which alternative route you will take instead. Use when: after reflection you judge that continuing the current direction is useless.

Rules: every segment of thinking must belong to exactly one tag; you may use several tags in sequence (e.g., <reflect> followed by <backtrack>); free-form thinking outside these tags is NOT allowed."""
